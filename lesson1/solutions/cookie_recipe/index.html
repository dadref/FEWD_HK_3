<h2>EXPERT TIPS</h2>

<p> Use an ice-cream scoop to make perfectly shaped cookies. Level off the dough on the edge of the bowl for perfectly round cookies.</p>


<p>If you didn't think these cookies could get any better, think again! Get creative! Instead of the 2 cups semisweet chocolate chips, make with 1/2 cup each of semisweet chocolate chips, peanut butter chips, or butterscotch chips. OMG these are good!</p>
